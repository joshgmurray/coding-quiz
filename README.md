# Code Quiz

## Description
I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using zero starter code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
2. WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
3. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
4. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
